Simple safety tips when exercising:
1. Warm up and cool down. Try slow stretches and go through the motions of your sport or activity before starting. Cool down with slow stretching.
2. Stay hydrated. You can lose around one and a half litres of fluid for every hour of exercise; so drink water before, during and after a session. However, take note that drinking too much water while exercising may result in stitches, therefore try not to drink too much water before or during a session, just a small quantity of water will be sufficient.
3. Pace yourself. Have at least one recovery day each week to rest. If you are experiencing pain, rest until the pain has gone. Excersing too much may result in injuries that will be detrimental to your body.
4. Do it right. Try to get the technique right from the beginning, to ensure you are using your muscles correctly. Doing an excercise incorrectly may result in unwanted injuries.


Basic tips on healthy eating and making healthier choices:
The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.
If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you will put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you will lose weight.
You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you are getting a balanced diet and your body is receiving all the nutrients it needs. This will allow you to lead a much healthier lifestyle.
1. Base your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates. Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals. Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on. They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.
2. Eat lots of fruit and vegetables. Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamin C and potassium. They're an excellent source of dietary fibre, which can help to maintain a healthy gut and prevent constipation and other digestion problems. A diet high in fibre can also reduce your risk of bowel cancer.
3. Eat more fish, including a portion of oily fish. Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals. Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish. Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease. 
4. Cut down on saturated fat and sugar. You need some fat in your diet, but it is important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating. There are 2 main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease. Try to cut down on your saturated fat intake and choose foods that contain unsaturated fats instead, such as vegetable oils and spreads, oily fish and avocados. All types of fat are high in energy, so they should only be eaten in small amounts. Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in sugar increases your risk of obesity and tooth decay. Sugary foods and drinks are often high in energy, and if consumed too often can contribute to weight gain. They can also cause tooth decay, especially if eaten between meals. Free sugars are any sugars added to foods or drinks, or found naturally in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies. This is the type of sugar you should be cutting down on, rather than the sugar found in fruit and milk.
5. Eat less salt. Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke. Even if you do not add salt to your food, you may still be eating too much. Use food labels to help cut down on the consumtion of salt.
6. Drink plenty of water. You need to drink plenty of fluids to stop you getting dehydrated. It is recommended to drink 6 to 8 glasses of water every day. This is in addition to the fluid you get from the food you eat. All non-alcoholic drinks count, but water, lower fat milk and lower sugar drinks, including tea and coffee, are healthier choices. Try to avoid sugary soft and fizzy drinks, as they're high in calories. They are also bad for your teeth. 
8. Do not skip breakfast. Some people skip breakfast because they are lazy. But a healthy breakfast high in fibre and low in fat, sugar and salt can form part of a balanced diet, and can help you get the nutrients you need for good health. A wholegrain lower sugar cereal with semi-skimmed milk and fruit sliced over the top is a tasty and healthier breakfast.
